\section{CS Policy on Graduate Student Leave}\label{appendix-b-cs-policy-on-graduate-student-leave}}

Please refer to the School of Engineering's \href{\GRtwentyfiveVL}{Vacation and Leave policy} in
the Graduate Record.

We aim to foster a friendly, cooperative, and professional relationship among graduate student assistants and faculty mentors in both education and research.

GTAs are expected to be available for the entire semester, starting from the planning of classes until grades are submitted. However, changes in GTA assignments can often happen at the beginning of each term. Once a GTA is assigned to a course, they should reach out to the instructor to clarify their duties, confirm whether attendance is required, and understand the instructor's plans and timeline for grading the final exam and submitting final grades. Any absences that are not due to acute illness must be approved by the instructor in advance. In accordance with UVA policy, the instructor will determine whether the GTA's responsibilities will be carried out in person or via telepresence.

GRAs work directly with their dissertation supervisor. GRAs should be in
frequent contact with their supervisor to determine research
assignments, publication deadlines, and expectations for on grounds vs.
electronic participation. Absences other than acute illness should be
approved in advance by the supervisor. Consistent with UVA policy, the
supervisor will determine whether the GRA's activities are to be
performed in person or via telepresence.

Students should not plan extensive travel until the dates of their
duties have been determined.

\subsection{Student Leaves}\label{student-leaves}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Short-term, acute illness should be reported via email to the course
  instructor or the research advisor.
\item
  In the case of lingering illness, the student must notify the research
  advisor and the Graduate Program Director. In the event of chronic
  illness, a student may wish to (a) try working remotely, (b) consider
  withdrawal, (c) consider taking a medical leave of absence (which is
  \emph{not} paid leave), or (d) seek temporary financial support from
  another source.
\item
  If a student is unable to return to the US because of visa issues, the
  student must inform the research advisor and a Graduate Program
  Director. Stipends may be affected based on the circumstances involved. Whenever visa issues arise, students should consult with the UVA International Studies Office (ISO).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{significant-life-events}{%
\subsection{Significant Life Events}\label{significant-life-events}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  GTAs, MTAs and GRAs who experience a significant life event (e.g.,
  birth, death, or trauma of a family member) should seek the advice of
  a Graduate Program Director. These special cases will be resolved
  individually in accordance with the Provost's Policy on Significant
  Life Events (PROV-027). See
  \href{https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-027}{{https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-027}}.
\item
  GTAs and GRAs who anticipate the birth of a child should seek the
  advice of a Graduate Program Director and may be able to take
  advantage of the Provost's Parental Accommodation for Graduate
  Students on Assistantship (PROV-028). See
  \href{https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-028}{{https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-028}}).
