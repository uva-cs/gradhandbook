# UVA CS Graduate Handbook

Starting in 2026 this is the source repository for the Computer Science Graduate
Program handbook at UVA.

## Building

1. Install latex on your machine.
2. Get the [latexrun](https://github.com/aclements/latexrun/blob/master/latexrun)
   python script and make it executable on your system. I put it in
   `/Users/username/.local/bin/`.
3. Run `make`.
